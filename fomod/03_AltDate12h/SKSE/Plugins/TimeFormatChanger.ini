# Use these tags to create a custom format:

# %D  - Day of week
# %h  - Hours (in 12h format)
# %H  - Hours (in 24h format)
# %m  - Minutes
# %a  - AM/PM
# %d  - Day of month
# %t  - Suffix after the day (In the english version of the game: "st", "nd", "rd" or "th")
# %o  - " of " (used between the date and the month: 17th of ..., contains spaces)
# %M  - Month of year (as a number)
# %L  - Month of year (full name)
# %E  - Era (always 4E)
# %y  - Year
# %i  - Immersive time of day

# Example (vanilla format):
# Turdas, 1:13 PM, 21st of Last Seed, 4E 201
# %D, %h:%m %a, %d%t%o%M, %E %y
#
# Warning: too long strings will get trimmed. The actual character limit depends on the content. It is recommended to try the longest possible date before use.
# You can force display any date if you change the format code to that specific date, like this:

# sTimeFormat="Loredas, 11:13 PM, 21st of Morning Star, 4E 201"

# This will always display "Loredas, 11:13 PM, 21st of Morning Star, 4E 201" regardless of the actual in-game time.
